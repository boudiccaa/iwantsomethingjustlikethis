            <h2>Please reconsider! I promise it will be amazing!<br>
                I know it might be way too late<br>
                but I am not someone who just gives up<br>
                that is probably also one of my flaws
            </h2>
            <p>
                Bless my heart, look in my eyes--my eternal pain<br>
                darkness divine--our souls intertwined<br>
                one look in your eyes makes me mesmerized<br><br>
                hopelessness sinking into Tartarus<br>
                an anchor keeping me afloat<br>
                in the darkness I shall seek<br>
                and all my sins shall I reap<br>
                just to get to the light at the end<br><br>
                of everything and nothing at all<br> 
                ecstasy in everything, makes me forget all;<br>
                the pain there is.
