            <p>
                I've got so much love to give,<br>
                a wasteland of affection<br>
                lies my heart in.<br><br>

                All I want is to be buried in the sand,<br>
                in his neck and in his arms,<br>
                in the very essence of his being,<br>
                the scent that lingers in.<br><br>

                I crave to bite into the forbidden fruit,<br>
                moaning as its juices flood my heart,<br>
                igniting a passion deep within,<br>
                a sweet surrender to our shared desire.<br><br>

                Oh, what shall it take<br>
                to get a chance to take a sip<br>
                from his oasis,<br>
                by a twist of fate?<br><br>

                To cure my soul,<br>
                to quench my thirst.<br>
                Too long I have been wandering<br>
                across the tapestry of time.<br><br>

                In the darkest corners of my mind,<br>
                where no spirit has embarked,<br>
                where things are dark and scary,<br>
                yet he remains.<br><br>

                Through the echo chambers of my heart,<br>
                I roamed, a restless soul,<br>
                in dreams where I could trace his face,<br>
                a canvas of purpose.<br><br>

                Forgive me, for I am my being and you yours,<br>
                yet I can't deny,<br>
                when we intertwine,<br>
                I open my eyes, calm divine.<br><br>

                I called for him in the dark,<br>
                with every whisper of the wind,<br>
                every star across the sky,<br>
                to let me drown in the ocean of his eyes.<br><br>

                In the chaos of this world,<br>
                he was my silent prayer,<br>
                for in his arms I find my peace,<br>
                and dance with my soul ablaze.<br><br>

                His presence is a soothing balm,<br>
                to my wounds that time could not heal.<br>
                In his eyes, I see a promise,<br>
                of love, bringing warmth to my weary heart.<br><br>

                I traverse through moonbeams,<br>
                chase every drop of his soul,<br>
                until the day I find myself,<br>
                because I found you.<br><br>

                My heart, once a barren wasteland,<br>
                now blooms with flowers beyond compare.<br>
                Nameless symphonies resonating within,<br>
                I ask myself, is this it?<br><br>

                In madness, be my solace,<br>
                like a soft breeze on a spring morning,<br>
                like dawn breaking the darkest of nights.<br>
                I find refuge, finally.<br><br>

                Oh, to be the breath he takes,<br>
                can we finally be free<br>
                from all this anguish laden?<br>
                Beyond, I need my heaven.<br><br>

                A kiss, a touch,<br>
                I find a home,<br>
                a sanctuary.<br><br>

                I rest in the certainty,<br>
                that I am loved, truly and deeply,<br>
                and in his love,<br>
                my soul is free.<br><br>
            </p>
            <p>
                I remember, when you told me once "a fresh rose petal falling that's glimmering<br>
                with a sparkle of morning water" and I still think about that from time to time.<br>
                Perhaps I have said too much. My point is, I love you and I will be<br>
                forever grateful<br>
                for you.<br>
